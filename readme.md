# Hyprland dotfiles
## My opinions
### Good
 - Great animations
 - Predictable tiling
### Bad
 - I need to be able to have titlebars on tabs
 - Occaisonal seemingly random locations of where a window moves to
 - Dwindle to side rathor then following the mouse
### Was a problem but since fixed
  - Firefox scrollbar fails when you focus another app (https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/1935)
